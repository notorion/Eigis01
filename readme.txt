Hey.
Eigis is a boss place of conquest. Only on Sunday night.
Eigis has a normal attack skill, and 3 special attacks. 1 Extra attack that pulls the players into the skill range.
Eigis's swords cut the floor, if you are fast, you can get out of the range.

At a certain distance EIGIS signals the player that will jump.

The original mechanics was not added due to lack of information, they are:
At some point this is happening when the NPC Device appears for 10 seconds:
The Magic Device is broken, and eigis is now unable to connect to the world end. You Attack Eigis when the world end is active, you will be punished.
The Magic Device is Destroyed, and the Dark Energy Reverse buff is applied allowing you to resist the world end.
You've Failed to Destroy The Magic Device, and Eigis' Health is Fully Restored.

Adaptations:
Original Skill teleports the player to the center of Eigis, in the adaptation I made the player to be pulled to the center of the boss.
The problem that I couldn't solve about this is that when you teleport the player to downtown Boss, he lost the target and the attack was reset, aggrolist zero. This prevents special attacks and normal skill attack from working.
